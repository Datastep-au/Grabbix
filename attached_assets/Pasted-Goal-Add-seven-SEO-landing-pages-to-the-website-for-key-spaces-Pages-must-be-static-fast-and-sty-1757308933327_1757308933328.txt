Goal: Add seven SEO landing pages to the website for key spaces. Pages must be static, fast, and styled to match the current site. Include schema, internal links, and a contact CTA. All copy is provided in pages.json attached.

Tech requirements:

Stack: Next.js with Tailwind CSS. No server code needed.

Create a route group at /use-cases/ for these pages.

Each page reads content from pages.json.

Components: PageHead, Hero, Prose, FeatureList, Steps, ProductMix, FAQ, CTA, Breadcrumbs.

Insert JSON-LD FAQ in <Head> for each page.

Add canonical to <Head> as https://grabbix.com.au/use-cases/[slug].

Internal links to existing routes:

Smart Store: /products/smart-store

Micro Market: /products/micro-market

Traditional Vending: /products/traditional-vending

Locations: /locations

Contact: /contact

Image handling: use one hero image per page from /public/images/use-cases/ with meaningful alt. Use temporary placeholders if needed and keep filenames predictable, e.g. offices-hero.jpg.

No symbol “—”. Use normal hyphens.

Mobile first, pass Lighthouse basics.

Render order per page:
Breadcrumbs
Hero (H1 + subhead)
Intro paragraph
Smart or Traditional block
FeatureList (benefits)
Steps
ProductMix
LocalNote (if present)
MiniCaseStudy (if present)
FAQ
CTA

Styling guidance:

Clean, light layout. Max width container max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4.
Hero: full-bleed hero, image in the background, and a rounded translucent card on the left with headline, subhead and a CTA in our website green colour.
Feature bullets with tick icons.
Steps as numbered cards.
CTA as a rounded card with button linking to /contact.

Implementation notes:

In [slug].tsx, load the page object by slug from pages.json. If no match, return 404.

<PageHead> should set title, meta description, canonical, and inject faqSchema as <script type="application/ld+json">.

Breadcrumbs: Home > Use Cases > [Hero H1].

Add internal links near the top of each page: Smart Store, Micro Market, Traditional Vending, Locations.

Buttons point to /contact.

QA checklist:

No symbol “—” in any content.

All internal links resolve.

Lighthouse mobile performance 90+.

JSON-LD validates on Google Rich Results Test.

Spelling uses British English.
